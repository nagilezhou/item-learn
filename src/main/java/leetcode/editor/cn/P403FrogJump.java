//A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, an
//d at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone
//, but it must not jump into the water.
//
// Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, deter
//mine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, th
//e frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.
//
// If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, o
//r k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.
//
//
// Example 1:
//
//
//Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
//Output: true
//Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd
//stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 unit
//s to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
//
//
// Example 2:
//
//
//Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
//Output: false
//Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the
//5th and 6th stone is too large.
//
//
//
// Constraints:
//
//
// 2 <= stones.length <= 2000
// 0 <= stones[i] <= 231 - 1
// stones[0] == 0
